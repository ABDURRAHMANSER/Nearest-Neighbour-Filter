# Nearest-Neighbour-Filter
Post Classification Processing  in this project, we have implemented Nearest Neighbor Filter for recheck the classified image and get higher accuracy of the classified image and that by setting the lower threshold value to two without the central pixel of a 3x3 mask of neighborhood pixels and the upper thresholds  is 4 so that the algorithm is but the mode of the neighborhood pixels and save it to another image
